# MobyViewer
This tool allows you to visualize Mobys in real-time from a chosen target platform (i.e. PS2 Emulator).

At the moment, only PS2Emu (PCSX2) is supported, and MobyViewer is only Win32 compatible.
More target platforms and functionnalities will be added in the future.

# Usage Guide
Currently visible Mobys have their title bar colored in orange, to allow for easy distinguishing.
Use the `Attach` button with PCSX2 launch to attach to the process, and all Mobys' data should appear.
Use the buttons in the `Options and filters` box to adjust the shown Mobys.
